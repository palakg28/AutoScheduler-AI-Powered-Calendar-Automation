# ü§ñ AI Calendar Agent ‚Äì Automated Scheduling with n8n  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the design and deployment of an **AI-powered automated scheduling agent** that streamlines business operations by turning raw spreadsheet bookings into **conflict-free, proximity-aware Google Calendar events**.  

Built with **n8n** and integrated APIs, the system automates data enrichment, applies scheduling rules (capacity, rest buffers, proximity), and writes results back to the source‚Äîeliminating manual coordination and ensuring operational efficiency.

## Visuals
Here‚Äôs the automated workflow for booking, staff assignment, and calendar integration:

![Workflow Diagram](images/workflow-overview.png)

## How it works (high-level)
- Google Sheets ‚Äúrow added‚Äù **triggers** the workflow.
- **Normalize** and detect if geocoding is needed; **enrich** with Google Maps when ward/postal is missing.
- Build two sets:
  1) **Confirmed ‚â• 2025-07-01** ‚Üí mock calendar for demo/validation.
  2) **Pending ‚â• 2025-07-01** ‚Üí **assign** staff using capacity/rest/proximity.
- Convert to **RFC 3339** (JST +09:00) and **create events**.
- **Write back** to the source sheet (recommended: also eventId + eventLink).

See the detailed diagrams and data contracts in `/docs`.

## Configuration
| Setting           | Default | Meaning                                   |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| `DAILY_CAP`       | 3       | max jobs per staff per day                |
| `REST_MINUTES`    | 60      | rest buffer on both sides of a booking    |
| `ALLOWED_IDS`     | 7,32,38 | staff restricted to John/Marjorie/Teresa  |
| `TZ`              | JST     | RFC 3339 timestamps include `+09:00`      |


## ‚ú® Features  
- **Automated Scheduling**: Transforms new rows in Google Sheets into optimized calendar events.  
- **Conflict-Free Assignments**: Enforces daily capacity limits, rest buffers, and overlap checks.  
- **Proximity-Aware Optimization**: Groups staff jobs by postal codes and wards to minimize travel time.  
- **Data Enrichment**: Normalizes and enriches incomplete addresses with the Google Maps Geocoding API.  
- **Bi-Directional Sync**: Updates the source sheet with status, event IDs, and links for full traceability.  
- **Reliability**: Implements idempotency, fallback logic, and RFC 3339 time compliance for production robustness.
