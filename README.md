# 🤖 AI Calendar Agent – Automated Scheduling with n8n  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the design and deployment of an **AI-powered automated scheduling agent** that streamlines business operations by turning raw spreadsheet bookings into **conflict-free, proximity-aware Google Calendar events**.  

Built with **n8n** and integrated APIs, the system automates data enrichment, applies scheduling rules (capacity, rest buffers, proximity), and writes results back to the source—eliminating manual coordination and ensuring operational efficiency.

## What this repo shows
- **End-to-end workflow** turning spreadsheet bookings into **calendar events**.
- **Address enrichment** (Google Maps Geocoding) → consistent `postal_code` + `ward_district`.
- **Scheduling engine** with **max 3 jobs/day**, **no overlaps**, and **1-hour rest buffers**.
- **Proximity** preference (same ward → same postal prefix), **load-balancing**, and fallback logic.
- **Dual calendars**: demo/mock for existing confirmed bookings and final for newly assigned ones.
- **Write-back** to the sheet (`Status = Confirmed`), with guidance for event IDs/links (idempotency).
- **Screenshots** of the workflow and the resulting calendars (proof & visualization).
- **Skills demonstrated**: n8n, Google Sheets/Calendar APIs, HTTP/REST, regex/JS data cleaning,
  scheduling algorithms, RFC 3339 time handling, and production-style documentation.

## Visuals
Here’s the automated workflow for booking, staff assignment, and calendar integration:

## How it works (high-level)
- Google Sheets “row added” **triggers** the workflow.
- **Normalize** and detect if geocoding is needed; **enrich** with Google Maps when ward/postal is missing.
- Build two sets:
  1) **Confirmed ≥ 2025-07-01** → mock calendar for demo/validation.
  2) **Pending ≥ 2025-07-01** → **assign** staff using capacity/rest/proximity.
- Convert to **RFC 3339** (JST +09:00) and **create events**.
- **Write back** to the source sheet (recommended: also eventId + eventLink).

See the detailed diagrams and data contracts in `/docs`.

## Configuration
| Setting           | Default | Meaning                                   |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| `DAILY_CAP`       | 3       | max jobs per staff per day                |
| `REST_MINUTES`    | 60      | rest buffer on both sides of a booking    |
| `ALLOWED_IDS`     | 7,32,38 | staff restricted to John/Marjorie/Teresa  |
| `TZ`              | JST     | RFC 3339 timestamps include `+09:00`      |


## ✨ Features  
- **Automated Scheduling**: Transforms new rows in Google Sheets into optimized calendar events.  
- **Conflict-Free Assignments**: Enforces daily capacity limits, rest buffers, and overlap checks.  
- **Proximity-Aware Optimization**: Groups staff jobs by postal codes and wards to minimize travel time.  
- **Data Enrichment**: Normalizes and enriches incomplete addresses with the Google Maps Geocoding API.  
- **Bi-Directional Sync**: Updates the source sheet with status, event IDs, and links for full traceability.  
- **Reliability**: Implements idempotency, fallback logic, and RFC 3339 time compliance for production robustness.
